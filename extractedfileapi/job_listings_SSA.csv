Client pricing is a fixed monthly fee, typically based on the number of workforce users and devices within their organization. DCS supplies all hardware and software that the client needs for basic operations and supports various “line of business” and accounting applications. DCS clients are typically businesses with 20-70 employees who use computers to perform their jobs and are in an industry that relies on a need for cybersecurity and industry compliance, such as New York-based insurance companies that have to be compliant with 23 NYCRR Part 500, HIPAA Hi-Tech, FINRA or ITAR compliance. Although many of our clients are generalized small businesses that rely on computers, such as legal, manufacturing, and financial verticals, we focus on cybersecurity and compliance. As a leading Managed IT Service Provider (MSP), DCS consists of highly skilled IT support professionals. They focus as a team on maintaining our client’s IT infrastructure and technology on an ongoing basis. DCS uses the leading MSP industry tools that help us be proactive and in front of issues rather than reactive to problems, help to eliminate unexpected downtime, and reduce helpdesk interactions. By improving cybersecurity understanding, we help foster environments where the client is part of the human firewall, which leads to increased business continuity, lowering expenses due to downtime, and increased efficiency. Our goals are to exceed industry standards for performance, operation, and customer service while achieving sustainable growth in this challenging but ever-expanding field of business to gain an ever-increasing organic market share.
